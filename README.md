Getting Started
build your server using backend node.js and express then do the following steps: Recive the data from the user using (form). Collect the data from the form Send the request from the react app to the third party using (axios) Now we send the data that we collect from form to search on it in the location Iq server We find our data as an array of objectâ€¦ we collect our data from one of these objects and store it in variables. After that we display the result to the user.
